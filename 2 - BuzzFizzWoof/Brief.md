Rather straightforward - a game often played in schools for children to learn how to divide.

Each child must say a number, and the next one in sequence must say the next number.

However, there are certain rules:

If a number is divisible by 3, they must say Fizz.
If a number is divisible by 5, they must say Buzz.
If a number is divisible by 7, they must say Woof.

This phrases can be combined, for example, 15 would return FizzBuzz.

Write a program that lists all numbers from 1-100, using the FizzBuzzWoof rules.
